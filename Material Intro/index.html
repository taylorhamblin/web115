                    <h1 class="center">Coral Reefs</h1>
                    <p class="center p80">Coral reefs are often called the rainforests of the ocean which often are homes to tens of thousands of extraordinary varieties of marine plants and animals. They are the most diverse ecosystems in the world and about one third of marine fish species live part of their lives on coral reefs. Coral Reefs are ancient animals related to jellyfish and anemones. An individual coral is called a polyp.  It is a very small and simple organism that consists of mostly a stomach topped by a tentacle-bearing mouth. The tentacles are extended at night to sting and ingest tiny organisms like plankton and other small creatures. Thousands of polyps live together to form a coral colony that build together to form a coral reef.  Reefs only occur in shallow areas that are reachable by sunlight.  This is beucase of the relationship between coral and algae.  Algae provides coral food and helps them grow faster. Reef building corals are like animals that act like plants, they stay in one place and get osome of their energy from the sun.  There are three different types of Coral Reefs called Fringing Reefs, Barrier Reefs, and Atoll Reefs. Scroll down to learn more about the 3 types of Coral Reefs.</p>

                        <p>Fringing reef is one of the three main types of coral reefs.  It is by far the most common of the three. How it is distinguished from the other main two types of reefs is that it has either an entirely shallow backreef zone, like a lagoon, or none at all.  If a fringing reef grows directly from the shoreline, it extends right to the beach and there is no backreef. In some cases, fringing reefs may grow hundreds of yards from the shore and contains extensive backreef areas with amny patch reefs and seagrass meadows.  This tye of reef is commonly found in the Caribbean and Red Sea. These types of reefs form on top of hard material such as limestone or volcanic rock.</p>

                                    This is a diagram of a barrier reef.  In the picture you can see that the reef extends from the shore and forms a lagoon in between the edge of the reef and the start of the shore. This type of reef is not as common but is considered the biggest coral reef in Australia, the Great Barrier Reef.

                            A barrier reef is basically a fringing reef that is seperated from the mainland or the island by a deep lagoon.  The coral grows on both the calm waters of the lagoon and the seaward reef front. The reef may form a sheld edge, or it can be located more inshore. These types of reefs are less common then fringing and atolls but is the largest reef type out there. The most popular and biggest barrier reef is the Great Barrier Reef located in Australia.  It stretches over 2,3000 kilometers and has over 2,900 individual reefs. They are found in the Atlantic and the Pacific sea.

                        <p>
                            An atoll reef, which is sometimes called a coral atoll, is a roughly circular shaped coral reef that surrounds a large central lagoon (often very deep). It is said that atolls are formed by gradual sinking oceanic islands over thousands of years or volcanos that have been eroded.  The reef around the island gradually grows as the center part crumbles and builds onto the edges. Then it forms a barrier reef until the center portion is completely under water which then turns into a circular atoll. For an atoll to grow, continued erosion that is slow enough to permit the reef to grow upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. Atoll reefs are foudn in the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
